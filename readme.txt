ELITE: THE NEW KIND

Gameboy Advance Version 1.7
============================

November 2005

This is release 1.6 of the GBA port of Elite - The New Kind. See the end of this
file for the history.

The original PC version is definitely no longer available from Christian Pinder's
New Kind website at http://www.newkind.co.uk :)

The latest Gameboy version can be found at http://www.geocities.com/quirky_2k1/

newkindgba.zip contains a compiled version of the code designed to run on the Gameboy Advance
using a flash card or similar "backup" device. It has been tested with a Flash Advance Pro 256M.

newkindgba_source.zip contains the GBA specific source code for Elite - The New Kind.
If you want to recompile the game then you will need:
> the Unofficial GameBoy Advance Software Development Kit available from http://www.io.com/~fenix/devkitadv/download.html
> gbalib - a gameboy advance mode 4 gfx and maths library available from Pete ( dooby@bits.bris.ac.uk / http://bits.bris.ac.uk/dooby/ )
> Krawall http://mind.riot.org/krawall/ - I have used the non-commercial GCC SDK version for mod play back and sound effects
